# This is what you need to know!

*Start with:*

###### Get yourself a "history"

> "It's easy to remember what you do, it's hard to remember what you've done"

Go to the WFTDA website and fill out the information.

They ask for.

* Email address
* The name you prefer. This can be your real name, your roller derby name, or the name everyone uses. *Note!* It will say "History of (the name you choose)" in the file and it is quite complicated to change later so choose carefully.
* Your real name
* Your roller derby name
* The address of your Official History (if you have one from before)
* The URL address of a picture of you that you want to share with others. *Tip!* Choose a ipicture where they can see who you are. Remember that image should not be removed from the page it is on. So if it is an image that is on a locked page, it will unfortunately not work. But you can save an image in Google Drive and make it so that everyone with the link can read it and it should work. Otherwise, an open account on Imgur.com or similar works well.

When you press the share button, WFTDA will automatically take the information you entered and create a document for you. It will arrive at your specified address within minutes.

> Thought of everything? Good! Here is the link:

[Link to WFTDA registration](https://wftda.org/officiating/ohd/register?_gl=1*1ecq3r4*_ga*MTgxMjI2OTQxNi4xNjk3NDMxMjYx*_ga_SMDBMZV5VE*MTcwNDkxMTIxNi42LjAuMTcwNDkxMTIxNi4wLjAuMA..)

When the link has arrived in your email, click on the link and start filling in more information.

It may look scary but we take it step by step.

At the bottom of the document you will see different tabs

![Tabs](/static/skärmavbild-2024-09-09-kl.-05.02.28.png)

It's just the two in the middle *Game History* and *Profile* which you can fill in. Everything you fill in there is then used in the first two tabs *Summary* and *Stats*.

**Note!** Only the two tabs without a padlock should be used!



###### Start with Profile

{Cell name} if you know Excel, this is clear, everyone else can just skip these letters and numbers.

* {B1} At the top, your image should be visible if you entered the URL address and everything worked as intended.
* {B2} Otherwise, you have the option to fill in a new address and reload the page. This can be a bit tricky and not at all necessary. But it's nice to see how you look! (You don't have to do this if you want to or can't find a picture you like, then just leave it blank.)
* {D1} Here should be a QR code of your address
* {D2} Here you can enter a shortened version of the address of your history. [Bitly](https://bitly.com/) can help you with that. (This is just for your own sake, if you want to use it, not necessary at all, leave it blank if you like.)

###### Under your picture, it says *Official’s info*

* Name {B5} Enter the name you prefer. *For example*, if your derby name is CoOla Katten, you might normally be called Ola, fill in Ola.
* Pronoun(s) {B6} Pronoun you want people to use. *Note*, use English if you ever have to share your info with derby people who don't know your own language!
* Derby Name {B7} Your derby name, the long one.
* Legal Name {B8} Your real name. This is used for, among other things, insurance.
* Location {B9} The city closest to you. *For example*, I live in Ödåkra, but nobody really knows where it is, so I write Helsingborg which is the closest big city.. Then I add Sweden because it might be good for everyone outside Sweden to know. So in my cell it says Helsingborg / Sweden
* Email address {B10} Your email address (yes, maybe it was unnecessary information but now I had started to write on everthing so I continue despite the opacity)
* Phone number {B11} Your phone number, in this format: **(0012)1200000000**, Your country code between ( ) 
* Affiliated League {B12} Your league's name, or if you don't belong to any league, then write **Independent**.
* Assocation Affiliations {B13} If your league is part of a larger club. Does not need to be filled out.
* Skating Certification {B14} If you have any certificate as a skating official.
* Non-Skating Certification {B15} If you have any non-skating certification.
* WFTDA Customer ID {B16} The number that appears on your member page if you are a member of WFTDA, this is mainly for those who live in the USA as they require to be insurance through WFTDA. But it's perfectly fine to be a member anyway, you can do that on their site[ here](https://wftda.ps.membersuite.com/profile/CreateAccount_BasicInfo.aspx).
* Other important numbers {B17} If you have other numbers that are important. 

  *Note:* Here I have a link to a document that tells everybody about what I think is important information about me because I am autistic. I missed being able to share this in a simple way with those who take care of different events so this was my own way. However, it is not a rule and I still have to write that it is here with every application. More on that later.
* If you have, for example, diabetes or something else, this could be a good place to write.

> Finally, you only do this once if it doesn't need to be updated, good job!
>

###### The pink fields are filled in like this:

* WFTDA/League Role {A20} Do you have or have you had a role/job in your league or within WFTDA, please write what kind of role
* Date(s) {B20} During which period, use the format YYYY-MM-DD
* Clinics, Education and Certification History {D20} Courses you have taken (within roller derby), bootcamps or other certifications.
* Date {F20} When or during which period, use the format YYYY-MM-DD

  *Tips!* WFTDA has a lot of good courses that are free online. So take a look when you feel like studying a bit, you can pause in the middle if you want. [Official courses](https://learning.wftda.org/?_gl=1*227a4t*_ga*MTgxMjI2OTQxNi4xNjk3NDMxMjYx*_ga_SMDBMZV5VE*MTcwNDkxNTY1Ni43LjEuMTcwNDkxNTY2Mi4wLjAuMA..)



###### Fill in games

Then we take tab number two, ***Game History***

Here you will fill in all the games you have done.

> My standing tip is that as soon as you get confirmation that you will be working a game, fill in as much as possible right away. You can change as much as you want here, so if, for example, the tournament hasn't been given a name yet, or if you don't know it, come up with something so you yourself at least know what it is.
>
> You will receive an info pack before each event or match, if you don't receive it, I will summarize the most important information you need further down and you can ask the person in charge after the game.



How to fill in:

**Important!** The most recent match should always be at the top.

Which practically means you have to add a new line every time you fill in a new match. On the top row under the headings {B2} the one in the picture marked in blue: right click, select “+ insert 1 row above”. You write on the line that pops up.

![Games tab](/static/skärmavbild-2024-09-09-kl.-05.10.38.png)

For everything to work in the summation and stats later, it must be filled in correctly. So the format itself is suuuuper important. The cell will be bright neon if you have filled in the cell incorrectly. Just double-check capital letters, etc.

> We take it one column at a time.

* Date {A2} The date of that particular game is, if you have several games in one day, you have to add more rows, one for each game. Use the format YYYY-MM-DD
* Event Name {B2} The name of the game or event, eg Hjulscrim 2023. Even if it's just called Hjulscrim, write the year after, then it will be easier to tell them apart if you redo the event every year.
* Event Location {C2} The city and country.
* Event Host {D2} The team/league that is organizing the event/game/bout/scrim. (Often the league from that city)
* Home / High Seed {E2} The home team or the team with the highest seed. Or just one of the teams. *Tip*, if it is a sanction game, you can also enter which seed the team has at the time of the match. *Note!* it changes before each game.. Tex Crime City Rollers - B Team (366) 
* Visitor / Low Seed {F2} The visiting team or the team with the lowest seed. Or just the other team.*Tip*, if it is a sanction game, you can also enter which seed the team has at the time of the match. *Note!* it changes before each game.. Tex Crime City Rollers - B Team (366) 
* Association {G2} The governing organization of the Games. Mostly WFTDA, if not mentioned.  WFTA, MRDA, JRDA. 
* Game Type {H2} What kind of game it is. Leave blank if you are unsure. *Tip,* If you don't find out via an info pack, you can figure it out yourself via this [very complicated explanation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M7efc8znw5ZK7272_aWIXBU18Zci9bBYQfDgMXof-l0/edit#heading=h.5f2p2hgfbivj). *Obs*, this must be entered exactly as it says, capital letters and small letters in the correct order. Reg, Sanc, Other.
* Position {I2} Your role, what was it you did. (yip finally!) All the different abbreviations and explanations on them. *Note*, it can only be these abbreviations, no others and only in capital letters!
* 2nd Position {J2} If you had another role, fill it in here. If you were Alt, enter your active role if you got one like this. If not, leave it blank.
* Software {K2} If you have been SBO, used ePLT or any other kind of tech, it must be filled in here. If you haven't used any tech, just leave it blank. C for CRG, O for Other, R for Rinxter and U for Ultimate. *Only these letters and capitals.*
* Head Referee {L2} The derby name of the Head ref for this game.
* Head NSO {M2} The derby name of the Head NSO for this game.
* Notes {N2} Everything else. E.g. Tournament HR and THNSO, if there was a certain division that played, juniors and what level, if there was any special rule, shorter playing time, etc., etc. You don't have to fill in anything, but any information that others may need to know about this particular match is good to fill in.



> ### Tada! You have filled in your first line, hope you get more!
>

###### If you haven't received an infopack, this is a good summary of information you can ask those responsible for the game for:



* Event name. 
* The league that organizes the game. 
* Who played as a home team and away team. 
* What kind of game it was, Reg, Sanc or Other. 
* Who were HR and HNSO.



Now all the other tabs will be updated with your information.



###### Apply for various games

In various groups on Facebook, leagues post that they need officials. It says when the game is played, where it is and usually what kind of officials are needed. If they accept all different levels of officials, they usually write it. Sometimes they accommodate it if you need to sleep over and if you're lucky, you can get some travel compensation. (You can always ask if there is a pot to apply for, as long as you don't assume that. We do this for fun, not to make any money.)

You usually just click on the link to their application form and fill in the information they ask for.

You can click and just read more information, you don't have to apply just because you clicked on the link.

The information you fill in is usually this:

* Your mail
* Your name and derby name
* Pronoun
* League
* Address to your Facebook page. You can find it if you click on your own page on fb and look in the address field. Mine looks like this: https://www.facebook.com/waspbee.nso/, I just write @waspbee.nso and you will find me. You can use both methods.
* What kind of official you want to be, skating, non-skating or both. 
* If you fill in more than one role, they usually want you to rank them from most wanted to least wanted. Use the abbreviation for the position.
* The link to your History, you can use the short version, but it is fine to just copy what is written in the address field when you have your History open copy and paste.
* Other information, here you can write if you are new to a position but would like to try it or if you have a position that is your favorite.
* If you have written something in "Other important numbers", write that there is more information to be found there. Even if you need somewhere to sleep or help with something. If you are allergic or similar, it can also be good to fill in. It looks like you can only write one line but you can write more.

***Note*** Any information you leave here can be read by anyone who has access to the document and sometimes this is shared with everyone who has completed it. So don't leave anything private, take that information via email or messenger instead.

Don't forget to write down the date of the game so you don't book several things that day. Some leagues are quick to say if you get the place, while others wait until a week before. If you need quick confirmation that you will be participating, write it down or notify the person who submitted the application.



###### Before game day

A group or event for officials is usually created on Facebook before the game. If you haven't been invited a week before, write and ask if they missed adding you.

Schedules for the day usually appear here and many changes are posted here. Click that you want all notifications so you don't miss anything. And (as we all know) since FB has a tendency to miss sending notifications, make it a habit to go in the day before and in the morning of the event and check so you don't miss any important information.



###### Things I came up with, during my short time as NSO

> Food, rest and clothes

*Food*

During a game day, a million things happen. It's easy to get caught up in the wonderful atmosphere and drive on. But if you want to be able to cope, you don't have to participate in everything, you need to fill up with energy.

* Eat before the game, a sandwich or fruit.
* Eat during the break, it's only 15 minutes (if you're lucky) but you'll have time to chow down on something.
* Eat after the game and especially if you have several games on the same day.
* If you want to be guaranteed to eat something you like, bring your own food. Next to all have food service but they should fit all. If vegan food isn't something you're in to, bring something you know you like.
* Boiling water is almost always available, coffee, basically yes, sometimes regular coffee, sometimes Nescafe. And if you are like me and are not super fond of oat milk, put a small bottle of your milk in your bag. I have a slight aversion to cardboard cups so I have my own thermos mug for my coffee.
* Candy! Sugar is quick energy, keep it in your pocket or bag. (Pass it around to anyone who seems to need it!)
* Water, energy drinks and more water.

*Rest!* 

Three games or more in one day? Rest, lie down in an empty corner and close your eyes for ten minutes. All the impressions and people can be overwhelming and ten minutes with your music or earplugs and just closing your eyes makes a huge difference. I've seen people who have a blanket with them to snuggle up properly. Go outside for a while and just listen to something else that doesn't involve whistles.

*Clothes*

There is something about sports halls, they are freezing cold, or boiling hot. There seems to be no middle ground.

* Bring your thick sweater, gloves and leg warmers.
* Fan is luxurious, and is on my wish list.

> #### Have fun, ask if you don't know and ask if you want to know more!
